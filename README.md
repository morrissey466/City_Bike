The purpose of this analysis is to create visualizations on city bike usage data to determine if it's a good investmet. We put together several graphs showing when the bikes are used, who uses them, and the duration of use.

## Conclusion 

From the data we can conclude that most trips last for less than 20 min indicating that most users use the bikes for short trips. More man use the bikes than women. Also the bikes are used most often at rush hour times. It would be beneficial to see the trip length. Also it would be interesting to break down riders by age.
